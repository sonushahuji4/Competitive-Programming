# Note:
# 1. Do it with merge sort first.
# 2. Then try it with Fenwick or Binary indexed tree.
# 3. After that, if you want you can solve it using,
# * AVL tree (Self-balancing BST)
# * Segment tree
# 4. By trying out these things, you will get used to those data structures and algorithms.
# 5. Also use long data type in java and long long in c++ to count the number of inversions.
